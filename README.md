# Siret : Validate

## Description
During one of my project I figured out that no siret was availabvle to check if one 
Siret number was valid. This package will do so.


If you use composer you can simply run 
```
composer require tyteck/siret
```

## TODO
* some siret are specific and do not comply with standatd validation
    * la poste
    * siret from monaco
* generate fake siret number for factories
* truly verify if siret is assigned to a company (if possible)
